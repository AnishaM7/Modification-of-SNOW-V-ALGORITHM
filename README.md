# Modification-of-SNOW-V-ALGORITHM
Stream ciphers are often used for their speed and simplicity of implementation in hardware, and in applications where plaintext comes in quantities of unknowable length like a secure wireless connection. SNOW-V system is one such cryptographic stream cipher system in the SNOW family of stream ciphers. 
# Modifications :
1.Extra FSM update function
2.Factorisation of inputs given to 32-bit aaddition
